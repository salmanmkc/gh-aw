# Daily Status Report

Generate a daily status report for the gh-aw project.

**Requirements:**
1. Analyze the current state of the repository
2. Check for recent commits, pull requests, and issues
3. Identify any potential issues or areas needing attention
4. Create a comprehensive daily status report
5. Post the report as an issue with the date in the title

Keep the report informative but concise.

**Important**: If no action is needed after completing your analysis, you **MUST** call the `noop` safe-output tool with a brief explanation. Failing to call any safe-output tool is the most common cause of safe-output workflow failures.

```json
{"noop": {"message": "No action needed: [brief explanation of what was analyzed and why]"}}
```
