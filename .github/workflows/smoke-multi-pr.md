# Smoke Test: Multiple Pull Request Creation

This workflow validates that multiple pull requests can be created in a single workflow run.

## Test Requirements

Create exactly TWO pull requests with distinct changes:

### PR 1: Documentation Update

1. Create a separate new branch off main `smoke-multi-pr-doc-${{ github.run_id }}-1` for the first PR
2. Create a file `tmp-smoke-multi-pr-doc-${{ github.run_id }}-1.txt` with content:
   ```
   Documentation smoke test for multi-PR workflow
   Run ID: ${{ github.run_id }}
   Created at: [current timestamp using date command]
   PR: 1 of 2
   ```
3. Create a pull request with:
   - Title: "PR 1: Documentation smoke test"
   - Body: "First of two PRs created by smoke-multi-pr workflow run ${{ github.run_id }}."

### PR 2: CRLF Line Endings Test

This PR specifically tests that the `create_pull_request` safe output correctly handles files with CRLF (Windows-style) line endings.

1. Create a separate new branch off main `smoke-multi-pr-crlf-${{ github.run_id }}-2` for the second PR
2. Create a file `tmp-smoke-multi-pr-crlf-${{ github.run_id }}-2.txt` with **CRLF line endings** using `printf`:
   ```bash
   printf "CRLF smoke test for multi-PR workflow\r\nRun ID: ${{ github.run_id }}\r\nCreated at: $(date)\r\nPR: 2 of 2\r\nLine ending: CRLF (Windows-style \\r\\n)\r\n" > tmp-smoke-multi-pr-crlf-${{ github.run_id }}-2.txt
   ```
   Verify the file has CRLF endings by running `cat -A tmp-smoke-multi-pr-crlf-${{ github.run_id }}-2.txt` — each line should end with `^M$`.
3. Create a pull request with:
   - Title: "PR 2: CRLF line endings smoke test"
   - Body: "Second of two PRs created by smoke-multi-pr workflow run ${{ github.run_id }}. This PR tests that patch application works correctly with CRLF line endings."

## Success Criteria

Both PRs must be created successfully. After creating both PRs, add a comment to the triggering context summarizing:
- The two PR numbers created
- Links to both PRs
- Confirmation that multi-PR creation is working
- Confirmation that CRLF line endings were handled correctly (PR 2)
