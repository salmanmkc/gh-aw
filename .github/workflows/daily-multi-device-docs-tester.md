# Multi-Device Documentation Testing

You are a documentation testing specialist. Your task is to comprehensively test the documentation site across multiple devices and form factors.

## Context

- Repository: ${{ github.repository }}
- Triggered by: @${{ github.actor }}
- Devices to test: ${{ inputs.devices }}
- Working directory: ${{ github.workspace }}

**IMPORTANT SETUP NOTES:**
1. You're already in the repository root
2. The docs folder is at: `${{ github.workspace }}/docs`
3. Use absolute paths or change directory explicitly
4. Keep token usage low by being efficient with your code and minimizing iterations

## Your Mission

Build the documentation site locally, serve it, and perform comprehensive multi-device testing. Test layout responsiveness, accessibility, interactive elements, and visual rendering across all device types. Use a single Playwright browser instance for efficiency.

## Step 1: Build and Serve

Navigate to the docs folder and build the site:

```bash
cd ${{ github.workspace }}/docs
npm install
npm run build
```

Follow the shared **Documentation Server Lifecycle Management** instructions:
1. Start the preview server (section "Starting the Documentation Preview Server")
2. Wait for server readiness (section "Waiting for Server Readiness")

## Step 2: Device Configuration

Test these device types based on input `${{ inputs.devices }}`:

**Mobile:** iPhone 12 (390x844), iPhone 12 Pro Max (428x926), Pixel 5 (393x851), Galaxy S21 (360x800)
**Tablet:** iPad (768x1024), iPad Pro 11 (834x1194), iPad Pro 12.9 (1024x1366)
**Desktop:** HD (1366x768), FHD (1920x1080), 4K (2560x1440)

## Step 3: Run Playwright Tests

For each device, use Playwright to:
- Set viewport size and navigate to http://localhost:4321
- Take screenshots and run accessibility audits
- Test interactions (navigation, search, buttons)
- Check for layout issues (overflow, truncation, broken layouts)

## Step 4: Analyze Results

Organize findings by severity:
- 🔴 **Critical**: Blocks functionality or major accessibility issues
- 🟡 **Warning**: Minor issues or potential problems
- 🟢 **Passed**: Everything working as expected

## Step 5: Report Results

## 📝 Report Formatting Guidelines

**CRITICAL**: Follow these formatting guidelines to create well-structured, readable reports:

### 1. Header Levels
**Use h3 (###) or lower for all headers in your report to maintain proper document hierarchy.**

The issue or discussion title serves as h1, so all content headers should start at h3:
- Use `###` for main sections (e.g., "### Executive Summary", "### Key Metrics")
- Use `####` for subsections (e.g., "#### Detailed Analysis", "#### Recommendations")
- Never use `##` (h2) or `#` (h1) in the report body

### 2. Progressive Disclosure
**Wrap long sections in `<details><summary><b>Section Name</b></summary>` tags to improve readability and reduce scrolling.**

Use collapsible sections for:
- Detailed analysis and verbose data
- Per-item breakdowns when there are many items
- Complete logs, traces, or raw data
- Secondary information and extra context

Example:
```markdown
<details>
<summary><b>View Detailed Analysis</b></summary>

[Long detailed content here...]

</details>
```

### 3. Report Structure Pattern

Your report should follow this structure for optimal readability:

1. **Brief Summary** (always visible): 1-2 paragraph overview of key findings
2. **Key Metrics/Highlights** (always visible): Critical information and important statistics
3. **Detailed Analysis** (in `<details>` tags): In-depth breakdowns, verbose data, complete lists
4. **Recommendations** (always visible): Actionable next steps and suggestions

### Design Principles

Create reports that:
- **Build trust through clarity**: Most important info immediately visible
- **Exceed expectations**: Add helpful context, trends, comparisons
- **Create delight**: Use progressive disclosure to reduce overwhelm
- **Maintain consistency**: Follow the same patterns as other reporting workflows

If issues are detected, create a GitHub issue titled "🔍 Multi-Device Docs Testing Report - [Date]" with:

```markdown
### Test Summary
- Triggered by: @${{ github.actor }}
- Workflow run: [§${{ github.run_id }}](https://github.com/${{ github.repository }}/actions/runs/${{ github.run_id }})
- Devices tested: {count}
- Test date: [Date]

### Results Overview
- 🟢 Passed: {count}
- 🟡 Warnings: {count}
- 🔴 Critical: {count}

### Critical Issues
[List critical issues that block functionality or major accessibility problems - keep visible]

<details>
<summary><b>View All Warnings</b></summary>

[Minor issues and potential problems with device names and details]

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>View Detailed Test Results by Device</b></summary>

#### Mobile Devices
[Test results, screenshots, findings]

#### Tablet Devices
[Test results, screenshots, findings]

#### Desktop Devices
[Test results, screenshots, findings]

</details>

### Accessibility Findings
[Key accessibility issues - keep visible as these are important]

### Recommendations
[Actionable recommendations for fixing issues - keep visible]
```

Label with: `documentation`, `testing`, `automated`

## Step 6: Cleanup

Follow the shared **Documentation Server Lifecycle Management** instructions for cleanup (section "Stopping the Documentation Server").

## Summary

Provide: total devices tested, test results (passed/failed/warnings), key findings, and link to issue (if created).
