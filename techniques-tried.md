Key insight: iptables NAT at kernel level intercepts even raw syscalls (ctypes). Application-layer proxy bypasses universally fail. Alternative protocols (SCTP, DCCP) not routed by iptables.

**Summary**: All 30 novel techniques blocked successfully. Achieved 100% novelty rate - all techniques are NEW and significantly different from prior 18 runs. Key findings:
1. iptables NAT operates at kernel level and intercepts ALL TCP connections including raw syscalls
2. Capabilities (NET_ADMIN, NET_RAW, SYS_CHROOT) confirmed dropped post-setup

**Summary**: All 30 novel techniques blocked successfully. 100% novelty score - ALL techniques are NEW and have NOT been tested in prior 19 runs. Key findings:
1. iptables NAT operates at kernel level below application layer (intercepts /dev/tcp, Node.js, Python sockets)
2. All capabilities requiring NET_ADMIN/NET_RAW/SYS_PTRACE confirmed dropped (ping6, strace, GRE, AF_PACKET blocked)
3. /proc filesystem restrictions: /proc/self/environ read-only, /proc/1/root not accessible, /proc/modules missing
4. Seccomp mode 2 active (syscall filtering) + AppArmor docker-default profile enforced
5. /dev/net/tun device exists (crw-rw-rw-) but in bad state without CAP_NET_ADMIN
6. Squid 6.13 enforces strict domain ACL: rejects CONNECT tunnels (403), absolute URIs (403), cache injection, smuggling attempts
7. Race conditions ineffective: 100 concurrent asyncio connections all blocked by iptables NAT
8. DNS queries work but provide no HTTP bypass (timing observable but not exploitable)
9. Environment variables: HTTP_PROXY/HTTPS_PROXY point to 172.30.0.10:3128 (Squid), cannot be overridden
10. Language runtimes tested: Python, Node.js, Bash /dev/tcp - all intercepted by NAT

**Cumulative**: 485 techniques (20 runs), 1 escape found (patched in v0.9.1). **Sandbox currently secure.**

**Summary**: All 30 novel techniques blocked successfully. 100% novelty rate - all techniques NEW and significantly different from prior 20 runs. Key findings:
1. Gateway (172.30.0.1) HTTP service accessible but returns 404 - no bypass
2. Port timing shows 80/443 NAT'd to Squid (14ms), other ports timeout (1003ms)
3. DNS CHAOS queries return SERVFAIL (Google DNS doesn't support CHAOS)
4. Squid ACL is case-insensitive and handles Unicode normalization
5. HTTP/1.0 legacy protocol also redirected to Squid and filtered
6. SMTP (25), SSH (22), FTP (21) all blocked - only HTTP/HTTPS NAT'd
7. All application-layer libraries (Ruby, Python, Node.js) intercepted by iptables NAT
8. WebSocket upgrade and HTTP TRACE method both return 403 from Squid

**Cumulative**: 515 techniques (21 runs), 1 escape found (patched in v0.9.1). **Sandbox currently secure.**
