LabelOps uses GitHub labels as workflow triggers, metadata, and state markers. GitHub Agentic Workflows supports label-based triggers with filtering to activate workflows only for specific label changes while maintaining secure, automated responses.

## When to Use LabelOps

Use LabelOps for priority-based workflows (run checks when `priority: high` is added), stage transitions (trigger actions when moving between workflow states), specialized processing (different workflows for different label categories), and team coordination (automate handoffs between teams using labels).

## Label Filtering

GitHub Agentic Workflows allows you to filter `labeled` and `unlabeled` events to trigger only for specific label names using the `names` field:

```aw wrap
---
on:
  issues:
    types: [labeled]
    names: [bug, critical, security]
permissions:
  contents: read
  actions: read
safe-outputs:
  add-comment:
    max: 1

# Critical Issue Handler

When a critical label is added to an issue, analyze the severity and provide immediate triage guidance.

Check the issue for:
- Impact scope and affected users
- Reproduction steps
- Related dependencies or systems
- Recommended priority level

Respond with a comment outlining next steps and recommended actions.
```

This workflow activates only when the `bug`, `critical`, or `security` labels are added to an issue, not for other label changes.

### Label Filter Syntax

The `names` field accepts a single label (`names: urgent`) or an array (`names: [priority, needs-review, blocked]`). It works with both `issues` and `pull_request` events, and the field is compiled into a conditional `if` expression in the final workflow YAML.

## Common LabelOps Patterns

**Priority Escalation**: Trigger workflows when high-priority labels (`P0`, `critical`, `urgent`) are added. The AI analyzes severity, notifies team leads, and provides escalation guidance with SLA compliance requirements.

**Label-Based Triage**: Respond to triage label changes (`needs-triage`, `triaged`) by analyzing issues and suggesting appropriate categorization, priority levels, affected components, and whether more information is needed.

**Security Automation**: When security labels are applied, automatically check for sensitive information disclosure, trigger security review processes, and ensure compliance with responsible disclosure policies.

**Release Management**: Track release-blocking issues by analyzing timeline impact, identifying blockers, generating release note content, and assessing testing requirements when release labels are applied.

## AI-Powered LabelOps

**Automatic Label Suggestions**: AI analyzes new issues to suggest and apply appropriate labels for issue type, priority level, affected components, and special categories. Configure allowed labels in `safe-outputs` to control which labels can be automatically applied.

**Component-Based Auto-Labeling**: Automatically identify affected components by analyzing file paths, features, API endpoints, and UI elements mentioned in issues, then apply relevant component labels.

**Label Consolidation**: Schedule periodic label audits to identify duplicates, unused labels, inconsistent naming, and consolidation opportunities. AI analyzes label usage patterns and creates recommendations for cleanup and standardization.

## Best Practices

Use specific label names in filters to avoid unwanted triggers (prefer `ready-for-review` over generic `ready`). Combine with safe outputs to maintain security while automating label-based workflows. Document label meanings in a LABELS.md file or use GitHub label descriptions. Limit automation scope by filtering for explicit labels like `automation-enabled`.

Address label explosion with AI-powered periodic audits for consolidation. Prevent ambiguous labels through AI suggestions and clear descriptions. Reduce manual upkeep by implementing AI-powered automatic labeling on issue creation and updates.
