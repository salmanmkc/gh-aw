Project operations require additional authentication since the default `GITHUB_TOKEN` lacks necessary permissions for the Projects API. You can authenticate using either a Personal Access Token (PAT) or a GitHub App token.

## Using a Personal Access Token (PAT)

1. Create the PAT

   **For User-owned Projects**:

   Create a [classic PAT](https://github.com/settings/tokens/new) with scopes:
   - `project` (required for user Projects)
   - `repo` (required if accessing private repositories)

   **For Organization-owned Projects (v2)**:

   Create a [fine-grained PAT](https://github.com/settings/personal-access-tokens/new?name=GH_AW_PROJECT_GITHUB_TOKEN&description=GitHub+Agentic+Workflows+-+Projects+authentication&contents=read&issues=read&pull_requests=read) (this link pre-fills the token name, description, and repository permissions) with:
   - **Repository access**: Select specific repos that will use the workflow
   - **Repository permissions**:
     - Contents: Read
     - Issues: Read (if needed for issue-triggered workflows)
     - Pull requests: Read (if needed for PR-triggered workflows)
   - **Organization permissions** (must be explicitly granted):
     - Projects: Read & Write (required for updating org Projects)
   - **Important**: You must explicitly grant organization access during token creation

2. Add the token to repository secrets

   ```bash wrap
   gh aw secrets set MY_PROJECT_TOKEN --value "YOUR_PROJECT_PAT"
   ```

3. Configure in your workflow frontmatter

   ```yaml wrap
   safe-outputs:
     update-project:
       github-token: ${{ secrets.MY_PROJECT_TOKEN }}

   tools:
     github:
       toolsets: [default, projects]
       github-token: ${{ secrets.MY_PROJECT_TOKEN }}
   ```

## Using a GitHub App

Alternatively, you can use a GitHub App for enhanced security. See [Using a GitHub App for Authentication](/gh-aw/reference/auth/#using-a-github-app-for-authentication) for complete setup instructions. Once set up, reference the app token in your workflow using `app:` on safe outputs and tools.

## Using a magic secret

Alternatively, you can set the magic GitHub Actions secret `GH_AW_PROJECT_GITHUB_TOKEN` to a suitable PAT (see the above guide for creating a suitable PAT). This secret name is known to GitHub Agentic Workflows and does not need to be explicitly referenced in your workflow.

```bash wrap
gh aw secrets set GH_AW_PROJECT_GITHUB_TOKEN --value "<your-pat-token>"
```

## Debugging: who owns a GitHub token?

Ownership affects token requirements for projects. If the owner is your personal username, it is user-owned. If the owner is an organization, it is org-owned and managed with shared roles and access controls.

To confirm ownership, check the owner name and avatar at the top of the page or in the URL (`github.com/owner-name/...`). Clicking the owner takes you to a personal profile or an organization page, which confirms it instantly. Here are examples of both (left: user-owned, right: org-owned):

<CardGrid>
  <Card title="User-owned repository">
    <picture>
      <source media="(prefers-color-scheme: dark)" srcSet="/gh-aw/images/user-owned_dark.png" />
      <img alt="User-owned repository example" src="/gh-aw/images/user-owned_light.png" />
    </picture>
    
    Avatar shows a personal profile icon, URL includes username
  </Card>

  <Card title="Organization-owned repository">
    <picture>
      <source media="(prefers-color-scheme: dark)" srcSet="/gh-aw/images/org-owned_dark.png" />
      <img alt="Organization-owned repository example" src="/gh-aw/images/org-owned_light.png" />
    </picture>
    
    Avatar shows organization icon, URL includes org name
  </Card>
</CardGrid>
