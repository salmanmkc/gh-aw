The following editors can be used to author, compile, and preview agentic workflows. Some are built-in tools maintained alongside gh-aw; others are community-created projects.

## Built-in editors

### Compiler Playground

An interactive browser-based playground that runs the gh-aw compiler entirely in the browser using [WebAssembly](/gh-aw/reference/wasm-compilation/). It demonstrates how to use the WASM build of the compiler directly in a webpage and shows how to compile workflows in the browser using the WASM-based execution engine.

## Community editors

> Community editors are created and maintained by independent contributors. They are not officially supported by the gh-aw project.

### Agentic Prompt Generator

A web-based tool for generating and editing agentic workflow prompts. It provides an interactive interface to help author workflow prompts for agentic workflows.

### Graphical Workflow Editor

A visual, graphical workflow editor that provides a richer UI for editing agentic workflows. Rather than working directly with markdown and YAML, this editor focuses on a more interactive and visual editing experience.
