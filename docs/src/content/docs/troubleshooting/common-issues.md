This reference documents frequently encountered issues when working with GitHub Agentic Workflows, organized by workflow stage and component.

## Installation Issues

### Extension Installation Fails

If `gh extension install githubnext/gh-aw` fails with authentication or permission errors (common in Codespaces outside the githubnext organization), use the standalone installer:

```bash wrap
curl -sL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/githubnext/gh-aw/main/install-gh-aw.sh | bash
```

After installation, the binary is installed to `~/.local/share/gh/extensions/gh-aw/gh-aw` and can be used with `gh aw` commands just like the extension installation.

### Extension Not Found After Installation

If you installed the extension but `gh aw` command is not found:

1. Verify installation: `gh extension list`
2. If not listed, reinstall: `gh extension install githubnext/gh-aw`
3. If issues persist, use the standalone installer (see above)

### Codespace Authentication Issues

GitHub Codespaces may have limited permissions for installing GitHub CLI extensions. If you encounter authentication errors:

1. Try the standalone installer (recommended for Codespaces)
2. Or grant additional permissions to your Codespace token

## Organization Policy Issues

### Custom Actions Not Allowed in Enterprise Organizations

**Error Message:**

```text
The action githubnext/gh-aw/actions/setup@a933c835b5e2d12ae4dead665a0fdba420a2d421 is not allowed in {ORG} because all actions must be from a repository owned by your enterprise, created by GitHub, or verified in the GitHub Marketplace.
```

**Cause:** Your enterprise organization has policies that restrict which GitHub Actions can be used. By default, workflows compiled by gh-aw use the custom action `githubnext/gh-aw/actions/setup` which may not be allowed by your organization's policy.

**Solution:** Enterprise administrators need to allow the `githubnext/gh-aw` repository in the organization's action policies. There are two approaches:

#### Option 1: Allow Specific Repositories (Recommended)

Add `githubnext/gh-aw` to your organization's allowed actions list:

1. Navigate to your organization's settings: `https://github.com/organizations/YOUR_ORG/settings/actions`
2. Under **Policies**, select **Allow select actions and reusable workflows**
3. In the **Allow specified actions and reusable workflows** section, add:
   ```text
   githubnext/gh-aw@*
   ```
4. Save the changes

For more details, see GitHub's documentation on [managing GitHub Actions permissions for your organization](https://docs.github.com/en/organizations/managing-organization-settings/disabling-or-limiting-github-actions-for-your-organization#allowing-select-actions-and-reusable-workflows-to-run).

#### Option 2: Configure Organization-Wide Policy File

If your enterprise uses a centralized `policies/actions.yml` file, add the gh-aw repository to the allowlist:

```yaml
# policies/actions.yml
allowed_actions:
  - "actions/*"  # GitHub-created actions
  - "githubnext/gh-aw@*"  # Allow gh-aw custom actions
```

Commit this file to your organization's `.github` repository. For more information about policy files, see GitHub's documentation on [creating a default community health file](https://docs.github.com/en/communities/setting-up-your-project-for-healthy-contributions/creating-a-default-community-health-file).

#### Verification

After updating the policy:

1. Wait a few minutes for the policy to propagate
2. Re-run your workflow
3. If issues persist, verify the policy was applied: `https://github.com/organizations/YOUR_ORG/settings/actions`

> [!TIP]
> Security Consideration
> The gh-aw custom actions are open source and can be audited at [github.com/githubnext/gh-aw/tree/main/actions](https://github.com/githubnext/gh-aw/tree/main/actions). The actions are pinned to specific commit SHAs in compiled workflows for security and reproducibility.

## Workflow Compilation Issues

### Workflow Won't Compile

If `gh aw compile` fails, check YAML frontmatter syntax (proper indentation with spaces, colons with spaces after them), verify required fields like `on:` are present, and ensure field types match the schema. Use `gh aw compile --verbose` for detailed error messages.

### Lock File Not Generated

If `.lock.yml` isn't created, fix compilation errors first (`gh aw compile 2>&1 | grep -i error`) and verify write permissions on `.github/workflows/`.

### Orphaned Lock Files

Remove old `.lock.yml` files after deleting `.md` files with `gh aw compile --purge`.

## Import and Include Issues

### Import File Not Found

Import paths are relative to repository root. Verify the file exists and is committed (`git status`). Example paths: `.github/workflows/shared/tools.md` (from repo root) or `shared/security-notice.md` (relative to `.github/workflows/`).

### Multiple Agent Files Error

Import only one file from `.github/agents/` per workflow. Use other imports for shared content like tools.

### Circular Import Dependencies

If compilation hangs, check for import files that import each other. Remove circular references by reviewing the import chain.

## Tool Configuration Issues

### GitHub Tools Not Available

Configure GitHub tools using `toolsets:` (recommended) or verify tool names from the [tools reference](/gh-aw/reference/tools/):

```yaml wrap
tools:
  github:
    toolsets: [repos, issues]  # Recommended: use toolsets
```

> [!TIP]
> Migrate to Toolsets
> If you're using the `allowed:` pattern with GitHub tools, consider migrating to `toolsets:` for better maintainability. Tool names may change between Model Context Protocol (MCP) server versions, but toolsets provide a stable API. See [Migration from Allowed to Toolsets](/gh-aw/guides/mcps/#migration-from-allowed-to-toolsets).

### Toolset Missing Expected Tools

If tools you expect are not available after configuring toolsets:

1. **Verify the right toolset**: Check the [toolset contents](/gh-aw/reference/tools/#toolset-contents) to find which toolset contains your tool
2. **Add additional toolsets**: Combine toolsets as needed (e.g., `toolsets: [default, actions]`)
3. **Inspect configuration**: Run `gh aw mcp inspect <workflow>` to see available tools

### MCP Server Connection Failures

Verify the MCP server package is installed and configuration syntax is valid. Ensure required environment variables are set:

```yaml wrap
mcp-servers:
  my-server:
    command: "npx"
    args: ["@myorg/mcp-server"]
    env:
      API_KEY: "${{ secrets.MCP_API_KEY }}"
```

**For comprehensive MCP troubleshooting**, see the [MCP Troubleshooting Guide](/gh-aw/troubleshooting/mcp-issues/) which covers:
- Connection timeouts and container issues
- Authentication errors (GitHub and custom servers)
- Configuration validation and toolset conflicts
- Network access and firewall issues
- Performance and resource problems

### Deprecated `mode` Field in Custom MCP Servers

**Error Message:**

```text
Additional property mode is not allowed
```

**Cause:** The `mode` field was removed from custom MCP server configurations. This field was previously used to specify the MCP server transport type but has been deprecated.

**Solution:** Remove the `mode` field from your custom MCP server configurations. The transport type is now automatically detected based on the configuration:

```yaml wrap
# Before (deprecated)
mcp-servers:
  my-server:
    command: "npx"
    args: ["@myorg/mcp-server"]
    mode: "stdio"  # Remove this line
    allowed: ["*"]

# After (correct)
mcp-servers:
  my-server:
    command: "npx"
    args: ["@myorg/mcp-server"]
    allowed: ["*"]
```

**Automatic Migration:** Run `gh aw fix --write` to automatically remove deprecated `mode` fields from all workflow files:

```bash wrap
gh aw fix --write
```

The `fix` command applies the `mcp-mode-to-type` codemod which removes the `mode` field while preserving all other configuration.

> [!NOTE]
> GitHub MCP Server Configuration
> The `mode` field is still valid for the GitHub MCP server (`tools.github.mode`) to choose between `local` (Docker-based) and `remote` (hosted) modes. This deprecation only affects custom MCP servers defined in the `mcp-servers:` section.

### Playwright Network Access Denied

Add blocked domains to the `allowed_domains` list:

```yaml wrap
tools:
  playwright:
    allowed_domains: ["github.com", "*.github.io"]
```

## Permission Issues

### Write Operations Fail

Grant required permissions in the `permissions:` section or use safe-outputs (recommended):

```yaml wrap
# Direct write
permissions:
  contents: read
  issues: write
  pull-requests: write

# Safe-outputs (recommended)
permissions:
  contents: read
safe-outputs:
  create-issue:
  add-comment:
```

### Safe Outputs Not Creating Issues

Disable staged mode to create issues (not just preview):

```yaml wrap
safe-outputs:
  staged: false
  create-issue:
    title-prefix: "[bot] "
    labels: [automation]
```

### Token Permission Errors

Add permissions to `GITHUB_TOKEN` or use a custom token:

```yaml wrap
# Increase GITHUB_TOKEN permissions
permissions:
  contents: write
  issues: write

# Or use custom token
safe-outputs:
  github-token: ${{ secrets.CUSTOM_PAT }}
  create-issue:
```

### Project Field Type Errors

If you receive errors like "The field of type repository is currently not supported" when using `update-project`:

**Problem**: GitHub Projects has built-in field types (like REPOSITORY) that are reserved and cannot be created or updated via the API. Using field names that match these reserved types causes errors.

**Solution**: Use different field names to avoid conflicts with GitHub's built-in types:

```yaml wrap
# ❌ Wrong - "repository" conflicts with REPOSITORY built-in type
safe-outputs:
  update-project:
    fields:
      repository: "myorg/myrepo"

# ✅ Correct - Use alternative field names
safe-outputs:
  update-project:
    fields:
      repo: "myorg/myrepo"              # Short form
      source_repository: "myorg/myrepo" # Descriptive
      linked_repo: "myorg/myrepo"       # Clear alternative
```

**Reserved field names to avoid**:
- `repository` (REPOSITORY type - not supported via API)

If a field already exists with an unsupported type, delete it in the GitHub Projects UI and recreate it with a different name.

## Engine-Specific Issues

### Copilot CLI Not Found

The compiled workflow should automatically include CLI installation steps. If missing, verify compilation succeeded.

### Model Not Available

Use the default model or specify an available one:

```yaml wrap
engine: copilot  # Default model

# Or specify model
engine:
  id: copilot
  model: gpt-4
```

## Context Expression Issues

### Unauthorized Expression

Use only [allowed expressions](/gh-aw/reference/templating/) like `github.event.issue.number`, `github.repository`, or `needs.activation.outputs.text`. Expressions like `secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN` or `env.MY_VAR` are not allowed.

### Sanitized Context Empty

`needs.activation.outputs.text` is only populated for issue, PR, or comment events (e.g., `on: issues:`) but not for other triggers like `push:`.

## Build and Test Issues

### Documentation Build Fails

Install dependencies, check for malformed frontmatter or MDX syntax, and fix broken links:

```bash wrap
cd docs
rm -rf node_modules package-lock.json
npm install
npm run build
```

### Tests Failing After Changes

Format code and check for issues before running tests:

```bash wrap
make fmt
make lint
make test-unit
```

## Network and Connectivity Issues

### Firewall Denials for Package Registries

If you're experiencing firewall denials when installing packages from npm, PyPI, Docker Hub, or other registries, add the appropriate ecosystem identifier to your network configuration:

```yaml wrap
network:
  allowed:
    - defaults       # Basic infrastructure
    - python        # For PyPI and pip
    - node          # For npm, yarn, pnpm
    - containers    # For Docker Hub, GHCR
    - go            # For Go modules
```

See the [Network Configuration Guide](/gh-aw/guides/network-configuration/) for complete examples, ecosystem domain lists, and troubleshooting steps.

### URLs Appearing as "(redacted)"

If URLs in workflow outputs or sanitized content show as `(redacted)`, the domain is not in the allowed list. Content sanitization automatically filters URLs from untrusted domains to prevent data exfiltration.

Add the domain to your workflow's `network:` configuration:

```yaml wrap
network:
  allowed:
    - defaults              # Basic infrastructure
    - "api.example.com"     # Add your domain here
```

Default allowed domains include GitHub domains (`github.com`, `githubusercontent.com`, etc.). For more configuration options, see [Network Permissions](/gh-aw/reference/network/).

### Cannot Download Remote Imports

Verify network access and GitHub authentication:

```bash wrap
curl -I https://raw.githubusercontent.com/githubnext/gh-aw/main/README.md
gh auth status
```

### MCP Server Connection Timeout

Use a local MCP server if HTTP connections timeout:

```yaml wrap
mcp-servers:
  my-server:
    command: "node"
    args: ["./server.js"]
```

## Cache Issues

### Cache Not Restoring

Verify cache key patterns match and note that caches expire after 7 days:

```yaml wrap
cache:
  key: deps-${{ hashFiles('package-lock.json') }}
  restore-keys: deps-
```

### Cache Memory Not Persisting

Configure cache properly for the memory MCP server:

```yaml wrap
tools:
  cache-memory:
    key: memory-${{ github.workflow }}-${{ github.run_id }}
```

## Debugging Strategies

Enable verbose compilation (`gh aw compile --verbose`), set `ACTIONS_STEP_DEBUG = true` for debug logging, inspect generated lock files (`cat .github/workflows/my-workflow.lock.yml`), check MCP configuration (`gh aw mcp inspect my-workflow`), and review logs (`gh aw logs my-workflow` or `gh aw audit RUN_ID`).

## Operational Runbooks

For systematic investigation and resolution of workflow health issues, see:

- [**Workflow Health Monitoring Runbook**](https://github.com/githubnext/gh-aw/blob/main/.github/aw/runbooks/workflow-health.md) - Comprehensive guide for diagnosing missing-tool errors, authentication failures, and configuration issues

The runbook includes step-by-step procedures, case studies from real incidents, and quick reference commands for workflow troubleshooting.

## Getting Help

Review [reference docs](/gh-aw/reference/workflow-structure/), search [existing issues](https://github.com/githubnext/gh-aw/issues), enable debugging with verbose flags, or create a new issue with reproduction steps.
