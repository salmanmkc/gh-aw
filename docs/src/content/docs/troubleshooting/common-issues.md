This reference documents frequently encountered issues when working with GitHub Agentic Workflows, organized by workflow stage and component.

## Installation Issues

### Extension Installation Fails

If `gh extension install github/gh-aw` fails with authentication or permission errors (common in Codespaces outside the githubnext organization), use the standalone installer:

```bash wrap
curl -sL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/github/gh-aw/main/install-gh-aw.sh | bash
```

After installation, the binary is installed to `~/.local/share/gh/extensions/gh-aw/gh-aw` and can be used with `gh aw` commands just like the extension installation.

### Install Script Fails in Restricted Network Environments

If the install script fails with "Failed to fetch latest release information from GitHub API" and exit code 22, your environment may have network restrictions blocking `api.github.com`. This commonly occurs in:

- GitHub Copilot agent runtime
- Corporate networks with MITM proxies
- Environments with strict firewall rules

**Solution 1: Specify Version with Skip Validation (Recommended)**

Bypass API validation by specifying a version explicitly:

```bash wrap
# Use the latest version number from https://github.com/github/gh-aw/releases
curl -sL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/github/gh-aw/main/install-gh-aw.sh | \
  bash -s -- v0.40.0 --skip-validation
```

Replace `v0.40.0` with the current latest version from the [releases page](https://github.com/github/gh-aw/releases).

**Solution 2: Use Direct Binary Download**

If the install script fails completely, manually download and install the binary:

```bash wrap
# 1. Create installation directory
mkdir -p ~/.local/share/gh/extensions/gh-aw

# 2. Download binary for your platform
# Linux (amd64)
curl -L -o ~/.local/share/gh/extensions/gh-aw/gh-aw \
  https://github.com/github/gh-aw/releases/download/v0.40.0/linux-amd64

# macOS (arm64)
curl -L -o ~/.local/share/gh/extensions/gh-aw/gh-aw \
  https://github.com/github/gh-aw/releases/download/v0.40.0/darwin-arm64

# 3. Make executable
chmod +x ~/.local/share/gh/extensions/gh-aw/gh-aw

# 4. Verify installation
~/.local/share/gh/extensions/gh-aw/gh-aw version
```

Available platforms: `linux-amd64`, `linux-arm64`, `darwin-amd64`, `darwin-arm64`, `windows-amd64.exe`

> [!TIP]
> Network Restrictions
> The `--skip-validation` flag is specifically designed for environments where GitHub API access is restricted. When used, the script skips version validation and attempts to download the binary directly from GitHub releases, which may be allowed even when API access is blocked.

### Extension Not Found After Installation

If you installed the extension but `gh aw` command is not found:

1. Verify installation: `gh extension list`
2. If not listed, reinstall: `gh extension install github/gh-aw`
3. If issues persist, use the standalone installer (see above)

### Codespace Authentication Issues

GitHub Codespaces may have limited permissions for installing GitHub CLI extensions. If you encounter authentication errors:

1. Try the standalone installer (recommended for Codespaces)
2. Or grant additional permissions to your Codespace token

## Organization Policy Issues

### Custom Actions Not Allowed in Enterprise Organizations

**Error Message:**

```text
The action github/gh-aw/actions/setup@a933c835b5e2d12ae4dead665a0fdba420a2d421 is not allowed in {ORG} because all actions must be from a repository owned by your enterprise, created by GitHub, or verified in the GitHub Marketplace.
```

**Cause:** Your enterprise organization has policies that restrict which GitHub Actions can be used. By default, workflows compiled by gh-aw use the custom action `github/gh-aw/actions/setup` which may not be allowed by your organization's policy.

**Solution:** Enterprise administrators need to allow the `github/gh-aw` repository in the organization's action policies. There are two approaches:

#### Option 1: Allow Specific Repositories (Recommended)

Add `github/gh-aw` to your organization's allowed actions list:

1. Navigate to your organization's settings: `https://github.com/organizations/YOUR_ORG/settings/actions`
2. Under **Policies**, select **Allow select actions and reusable workflows**
3. In the **Allow specified actions and reusable workflows** section, add:
   ```text
   github/gh-aw@*
   ```
4. Save the changes

For more details, see GitHub's documentation on [managing GitHub Actions permissions for your organization](https://docs.github.com/en/organizations/managing-organization-settings/disabling-or-limiting-github-actions-for-your-organization#allowing-select-actions-and-reusable-workflows-to-run).

#### Option 2: Configure Organization-Wide Policy File

If your enterprise uses a centralized `policies/actions.yml` file, add the gh-aw repository to the allowlist:

```yaml
# policies/actions.yml
allowed_actions:
  - "actions/*"  # GitHub-created actions
  - "github/gh-aw@*"  # Allow gh-aw custom actions
```

Commit this file to your organization's `.github` repository. For more information about policy files, see GitHub's documentation on [creating a default community health file](https://docs.github.com/en/communities/setting-up-your-project-for-healthy-contributions/creating-a-default-community-health-file).

#### Verification

After updating the policy:

1. Wait a few minutes for the policy to propagate
2. Re-run your workflow
3. If issues persist, verify the policy was applied: `https://github.com/organizations/YOUR_ORG/settings/actions`

> [!TIP]
> Security Consideration
> The gh-aw custom actions are open source and can be audited at [github.com/github/gh-aw/tree/main/actions](https://github.com/github/gh-aw/tree/main/actions). The actions are pinned to specific commit SHAs in compiled workflows for security and reproducibility.

## Workflow Compilation Issues

### Workflow Won't Compile

If `gh aw compile` fails, check YAML frontmatter syntax (proper indentation with spaces, colons with spaces after them), verify required fields like `on:` are present, and ensure field types match the schema. Use `gh aw compile --verbose` for detailed error messages.

### Lock File Not Generated

If `.lock.yml` isn't created, fix compilation errors first (`gh aw compile 2>&1 | grep -i error`) and verify write permissions on `.github/workflows/`.

### Orphaned Lock Files

Remove old `.lock.yml` files after deleting `.md` files with `gh aw compile --purge`.

## Import and Include Issues

### Import File Not Found

Import paths are relative to repository root. Verify the file exists and is committed (`git status`). Example paths: `.github/workflows/shared/tools.md` (from repo root) or `shared/security-notice.md` (relative to `.github/workflows/`).

### Multiple Agent Files Error

Import only one file from `.github/agents/` per workflow. Use other imports for shared content like tools.

### Circular Import Dependencies

If compilation hangs, check for import files that import each other. Remove circular references by reviewing the import chain.

## Tool Configuration Issues

### GitHub Tools Not Available

Configure GitHub tools using `toolsets:` (recommended) or verify tool names from the [tools reference](/gh-aw/reference/tools/):

```yaml wrap
tools:
  github:
    toolsets: [repos, issues]  # Recommended: use toolsets
```

> [!TIP]
> Migrate to Toolsets
> If you're using the `allowed:` pattern with GitHub tools, consider migrating to `toolsets:` for better maintainability. Tool names may change between Model Context Protocol (MCP) server versions, but toolsets provide a stable API. See [Migration from Allowed to Toolsets](/gh-aw/guides/mcps/#migration-from-allowed-to-toolsets).

### Toolset Missing Expected Tools

If tools you expect are not available after configuring toolsets:

1. **Verify the right toolset**: Check the [toolset contents](/gh-aw/reference/tools/#toolset-contents) to find which toolset contains your tool
2. **Add additional toolsets**: Combine toolsets as needed (e.g., `toolsets: [default, actions]`)
3. **Inspect configuration**: Run `gh aw mcp inspect <workflow>` to see available tools

### MCP Server Connection Failures

Verify the MCP server package is installed and configuration syntax is valid. Ensure required environment variables are set:

```yaml wrap
mcp-servers:
  my-server:
    command: "npx"
    args: ["@myorg/mcp-server"]
    env:
      API_KEY: "${{ secrets.MCP_API_KEY }}"
```

### Deprecated `mode` Field in Custom MCP Servers

**Error Message:**

```text
Additional property mode is not allowed
```

**Cause:** The `mode` field was removed from custom MCP server configurations. This field was previously used to specify the MCP server transport type but has been deprecated.

**Solution:** Remove the `mode` field from your custom MCP server configurations. The transport type is now automatically detected based on the configuration:

```yaml wrap
# Before (deprecated)
mcp-servers:
  my-server:
    command: "npx"
    args: ["@myorg/mcp-server"]
    mode: "stdio"  # Remove this line
    allowed: ["*"]

# After (correct)
mcp-servers:
  my-server:
    command: "npx"
    args: ["@myorg/mcp-server"]
    allowed: ["*"]
```

**Automatic Migration:** Run `gh aw fix --write` to automatically remove deprecated `mode` fields from all workflow files:

```bash wrap
gh aw fix --write
```

The `fix` command applies the `mcp-mode-to-type` codemod which removes the `mode` field while preserving all other configuration.

> [!NOTE]
> GitHub MCP Server Configuration
> The `mode` field is still valid for the GitHub MCP server (`tools.github.mode`) to choose between `local` (Docker-based) and `remote` (hosted) modes. This deprecation only affects custom MCP servers defined in the `mcp-servers:` section.

### Playwright Network Access Denied

Add blocked domains to the `allowed_domains` list:

```yaml wrap
tools:
  playwright:
    allowed_domains: ["github.com", "*.github.io"]
```

## Permission Issues

### Write Operations Fail

Grant required permissions in the `permissions:` section or use safe-outputs (recommended):

```yaml wrap
# Direct write
permissions:
  contents: read
  issues: write
  pull-requests: write

# Safe-outputs (recommended)
permissions:
  contents: read
safe-outputs:
  create-issue:
  add-comment:
```

### Safe Outputs Not Creating Issues

Disable staged mode to create issues (not just preview):

```yaml wrap
safe-outputs:
  staged: false
  create-issue:
    title-prefix: "[bot] "
    labels: [automation]
```

### Token Permission Errors

Add permissions to `GITHUB_TOKEN` or use a custom token:

```yaml wrap
# Increase GITHUB_TOKEN permissions
permissions:
  contents: write
  issues: write

# Or use custom token
safe-outputs:
  github-token: ${{ secrets.CUSTOM_PAT }}
  create-issue:
```

### Project Field Type Errors

If you receive errors like "The field of type repository is currently not supported" when using `update-project`:

**Problem**: GitHub Projects has built-in field types (like REPOSITORY) that are reserved and cannot be created or updated via the API. Using field names that match these reserved types causes errors.

**Solution**: Use different field names to avoid conflicts with GitHub's built-in types:

```yaml wrap
# ❌ Wrong - "repository" conflicts with REPOSITORY built-in type
safe-outputs:
  update-project:
    fields:
      repository: "myorg/myrepo"

# ✅ Correct - Use alternative field names
safe-outputs:
  update-project:
    fields:
      repo: "myorg/myrepo"              # Short form
      source_repository: "myorg/myrepo" # Descriptive
      linked_repo: "myorg/myrepo"       # Clear alternative
```

**Reserved field names to avoid**:
- `repository` (REPOSITORY type - not supported via API)

If a field already exists with an unsupported type, delete it in the GitHub Projects UI and recreate it with a different name.

## Engine-Specific Issues

### Copilot CLI Not Found

The compiled workflow should automatically include CLI installation steps. If missing, verify compilation succeeded.

### Model Not Available

Use the default model or specify an available one:

```yaml wrap
engine: copilot  # Default model

# Or specify model
engine:
  id: copilot
  model: gpt-4
```

## Context Expression Issues

### Unauthorized Expression

Use only [allowed expressions](/gh-aw/reference/templating/) like `github.event.issue.number`, `github.repository`, or `needs.activation.outputs.text`. Expressions like `secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN` or `env.MY_VAR` are not allowed.

### Sanitized Context Empty

`needs.activation.outputs.text` is only populated for issue, PR, or comment events (e.g., `on: issues:`) but not for other triggers like `push:`.

## Build and Test Issues

### Documentation Build Fails

Install dependencies, check for malformed frontmatter or MDX syntax, and fix broken links:

```bash wrap
cd docs
rm -rf node_modules package-lock.json
npm install
npm run build
```

### Tests Failing After Changes

Format code and check for issues before running tests:

```bash wrap
make fmt
make lint
make test-unit
```

## Network and Connectivity Issues

### Firewall Denials for Package Registries

If you're experiencing firewall denials when installing packages from npm, PyPI, Docker Hub, or other registries, add the appropriate ecosystem identifier to your network configuration:

```yaml wrap
network:
  allowed:
    - defaults       # Basic infrastructure
    - python        # For PyPI and pip
    - node          # For npm, yarn, pnpm
    - containers    # For Docker Hub, GHCR
    - go            # For Go modules
```

See the [Network Configuration Guide](/gh-aw/guides/network-configuration/) for complete examples, ecosystem domain lists, and troubleshooting steps.

### URLs Appearing as "(redacted)"

If URLs in workflow outputs or sanitized content show as `(redacted)`, the domain is not in the allowed list. Content sanitization automatically filters URLs from untrusted domains to prevent data exfiltration.

Add the domain to your workflow's `network:` configuration:

```yaml wrap
network:
  allowed:
    - defaults              # Basic infrastructure
    - "api.example.com"     # Add your domain here
```

Default allowed domains include GitHub domains (`github.com`, `githubusercontent.com`, etc.). For more configuration options, see [Network Permissions](/gh-aw/reference/network/).

### Cannot Download Remote Imports

Verify network access and GitHub authentication:

```bash wrap
curl -I https://raw.githubusercontent.com/github/gh-aw/main/README.md
gh auth status
```

### MCP Server Connection Timeout

Use a local MCP server if HTTP connections timeout:

```yaml wrap
mcp-servers:
  my-server:
    command: "node"
    args: ["./server.js"]
```

## Cache Issues

### Cache Not Restoring

Verify cache key patterns match and note that caches expire after 7 days:

```yaml wrap
cache:
  key: deps-${{ hashFiles('package-lock.json') }}
  restore-keys: deps-
```

### Cache Memory Not Persisting

Configure cache properly for the memory MCP server:

```yaml wrap
tools:
  cache-memory:
    key: memory-${{ github.workflow }}-${{ github.run_id }}
```

## Debugging Strategies

Enable verbose compilation (`gh aw compile --verbose`), set `ACTIONS_STEP_DEBUG = true` for debug logging, inspect generated lock files (`cat .github/workflows/my-workflow.lock.yml`), check MCP configuration (`gh aw mcp inspect my-workflow`), and review logs (`gh aw logs my-workflow` or `gh aw audit RUN_ID`).

## Operational Runbooks

For systematic investigation and resolution of workflow health issues, see:

- [**Workflow Health Monitoring Runbook**](https://github.com/github/gh-aw/blob/main/.github/aw/runbooks/workflow-health.md) - Comprehensive guide for diagnosing missing-tool errors, authentication failures, and configuration issues

The runbook includes step-by-step procedures, case studies from real incidents, and quick reference commands for workflow troubleshooting.

## Getting Help

Review [reference docs](/gh-aw/reference/workflow-structure/), search [existing issues](https://github.com/github/gh-aw/issues), enable debugging with verbose flags, or create a new issue with reproduction steps. See also: [Error Reference](/gh-aw/troubleshooting/errors/) and [Frontmatter Reference](/gh-aw/reference/frontmatter/).
